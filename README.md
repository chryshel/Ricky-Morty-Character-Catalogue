# Ricky-Morty-Character-Catalogue
a simple mobilen application that demonstrates my ability to consume a public API, manage navigation, and structure a maintainable codebase.

# Setup Instructions 
1. clone the project and run the application on Xcode - tested on iOS 18.2

# My Approach 
I have implemented https://rickandmortyapi.com public API.
My main priorities were to demostrate my ability to work with:
  - third party libraries: ex- [Moya a Network Abstraction layer](https://github.com/Moya/Moya)
  - TDD
  - MVVM architecture implemetation

# If you had another two days, what would you have tackled next?
I would increase the test coverage and I would implement a CI/CD pipeline 

# What would you change about the structure of the code?
I would modularize the codeÂ for example introduce common styling

# What bugs did you find but not fix?
I saw some potential improvements to the code such as :
 - Implement pagination
 - Implement a caching mechanism to reduce network calls
 - Implement a Image caching mechanism using a third party library ex: [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher)

# What would you change about the visual design of the app?
 - Implement Dark mode support
 - Implement a generic text styling guide line that supports rick and morty theme
